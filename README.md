### Description
This is a fabric mod that adds a body temperature system to the game.


Basically how it works is that in vanilla minecraft, biomes have there own built in temperature.
this mod will take that temperature and determine how hot or cold you should feel.
So it should work with any modded biomes as long as there biome temperature is set appropriately.
If you get too cold or hot you will start to take damage.

Heat making blocks will slowly increase your temperature if you are less than 3 blocks away.
Blocks that make heat are: torches 3, fire 3, lava 8, campfires 16.
You can also increase your temperature by wearing leather armor. Boots increase by 1, leggings 2,  chestplate 3 and helmet 1.

You will become colder if it rains, snows, at night or if you get in water.
Fire resistance will stop you from taking any damage from high temperature.
So if you are too hot drink fire resistance or make ice juice. (use [REI](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei/version/12.0.625+fabric) to see ice juice recipe).
